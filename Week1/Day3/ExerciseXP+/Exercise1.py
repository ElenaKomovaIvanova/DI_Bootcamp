# <!-- Instructions
# You are given a dictionary containing student names as keys and lists of their grades as values. Your task is to create a summary report that calculates the average grade for each student, assigns a letter grade, and determines the class average.



# Initial Data:


# student_grades = {
#     "Alice": [88, 92, 100],
#     "Bob": [75, 78, 80],
#     "Charlie": [92, 90, 85],
#     "Dana": [83, 88, 92],
#     "Eli": [78, 80, 72]
# }


# Requirements:
# Calculate the average grade for each student and store the results in a new dictionary called student_averages.
# Assign each student a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on their average grade according to the following scale, and store the results in a dictionary called student_letter_grades:
# A: 90 and above
# B: 80 to 89
# C: 70 to 79
# D: 60 to 69
# F: Below 60
# Calculate the class average (the average of all studentsâ€™ averages) and print it.
# Print the name of each student, their average grade, and their letter grade.
# Hints:
# Use loops to iterate through the student_grades dictionary.
# You may use sum() and len() functions to help calculate averages.
# Initialize empty dictionaries for student_averages and student_letter_grades before filling them with data. -->
